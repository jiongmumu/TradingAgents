Thank you, Ashish, and good morning, everyone.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.2\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Today, we reported another quarter of earnings that highlights the core strengths of General Motors. They include the appeal of our vehicles, customer loyalty to our brands, the growing value of technologies like OnStar and Super Cruise, as well as the creativity and resiliency of our global team. I am grateful for everyone\\'s contributions. Our employees, our dealers, and our suppliers. In the US and around the world, we have demonstrated consistent execution of our production and go-to-market strategies. We do have opportunities from a quality perspective at both the supplier and the GM level, which Paul will talk more about in his remarks, but we are fundamentally very strong and resilient. As we discussed today, we have delivered strong underlying operating performance and we are positioning the business for a profitable long-term future as we adapt to new trade and tax policies and a rapidly evolving tech landscape. Our clear priorities are to grow our already expansive US manufacturing footprint and domestic supply chain, further strengthen our international business, and continue to innovate in batteries, software, and autonomous technology. In China, we have been working closely with our JV partner to improve sales, inventory management, costs, and profitability. The performance of our new energy vehicles has been especially strong, and in Q2, we reported our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year sales growth. We were the only foreign OEM to gain share, and we reported positive equity income. In the US, the industry saw a spike in demand during the quarter due to tariff-related sales pull-ahead, especially in April and May. Then in June and July, demand returned to levels that are in line with our full-year outlook of 16 million units. Throughout the first and second quarters, GM outperformed the market in total, fleet, and retail market share year-over-year. We also gained total fleet and retail market share sequentially from Q1 to Q2 despite increased incentives from our competitors. We delivered all of this with inventories at the end of June that were down year-over-year by almost 10%. Our incentives remained well below industry average for both ICE and EVs; our pricing has been relatively consistent. I\\'m particularly pleased that the crossover portfolio we highlighted at our last Investor Day has been delivering record results. These ten all-new or redesigned crossovers took huge leaps forward in design and technology, resulting in strong demand and revenue growth while reducing complexity contributed to stronger profitability. The Chevrolet Equinox alone gained nearly six points of retail market share year-over-year in the industry\\'s largest segment, thanks to the popularity of both the ICE and EV model. We are growing in EVs because we have a strategic portfolio of vehicles that people love for their design, performance, range, and value. Five years ago, the EV market essentially had one player. Today, there are thirty. And Chevrolet is now the number two EV brand thanks to the success of the Blazer EV and the Equinox EV. And in Q2, Cadillac became the number five EV brand overall. Cadillac has also become the luxury EV leader, fueled by the launch of the Escalade IQ and conquest rates that are above 75% for the Lyric and approaching 80% for the Optic. At the same time, all-electric road trips are getting easier by the day thanks to our fast charging collaborations, which have been focused on regional interstate corridors outside. For example, GM Energy 350-kilowatt chargers are now available at nearly 200 pilot travel centers along I-75 between Michigan and Florida, on the routes between Minneapolis and Milwaukee, Detroit and Cleveland, San Antonio and Houston, and Dallas and Nashville. Stations are typically no more than 150 miles apart, so it\\'s easy to take long-distance trips knowing you\\'ll have access to reliable fast chargers and convenient services when you need them. In addition, the first of Iona\\'s charging stations, which can deliver up to 400 kilowatts, are now in service in North Carolina, Texas, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kansas, Arizona, and Missouri. By the end of the year, our customers will have access to more than 65,000 public fast charging bases across the country. That will grow to more than 80,000 by the end of next year and 100,000 by the end of 2027. A more than 50% improvement in just three years. The growth of our ICE and EV business is also fueling the expansion of our highly acclaimed Super Cruise technology, which in turn is helping guide the development of our personal autonomous vehicles. We\\'re making steady progress growing Super Cruise. The technology is now offered on 23 models, and we continue to add new capabilities. We\\'re on track to have more than 600,000 customers by year-end, each of whom has paid upfront for three years of service, with 70% of new Cadillacs delivered equipped with Super Cruise. Additionally, we have changed the way we approach the market for our OnStar products, and we now offer our vehicles to include a period of basic OnStar services. As a result, our OnStar subscriber totals are increasing at record rates. And we now have even more ways to engage directly with our customers throughout the life of the vehicle to drive our industry-leading loyalty even higher. As of today, we have booked $4 billion of deferred revenue from Super Cruise, OnStar, and other software services that we will recognize over time. Our projected Super Cruise revenue will be more than $200 million in 2025 and is expected to more than double in 2026. As we continue to scale, we anticipate growing at a robust double-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. We have also introduced a new and improved MyGM Rewards customer loyalty program and credit card portfolio. That gives our members access to more savings opportunities on GM products and services and exclusive access to member-only experiences like trackside access at racing events and off-the-grid EV excursions. We invested in these programs because our loyalty program members are very valuable. They buy vehicles with higher MSRPs and visit dealers for service at nearly twice the rate of nonmembers. To build on our leadership positions in ICE and increasingly in EVs, and develop new sources of competitive advantage in AV software and services, we continue to strengthen our team with experienced executives and tech innovators like Sterling Anderson. Sterling, who was the cofounder and chief product officer for an autonomous trucking company Aurora, is now GM\\'s chief product officer. We are also embracing AI across the enterprise, which is why we recruited Google and Cisco veteran, Barack Tawawski, to lead our efforts under Apple veteran, Dave Richardson, who leads software and services engineering. Barrack is building a world-class team of applied AI experts and researchers as we redefine how intelligence powers vehicle performance, customer experience, and operational excellence at GM. I believe everything we\\'re doing strategically and proactively along with closer alignment of emissions rules with consumer demand, will further differentiate us from our competitors, increase our resiliency, and drive overall profitability. For example, the $4 billion of new investment in our US assembly plants will add 300,000 units of US capacity for high-margin light-duty pickups, full-size SUVs, and crossovers to help us greatly reduce our tariff exposure, satisfy unmet customer demand, and capture upside opportunities as we launch new models. The capacity begins coming online in just 18 months, after which we project building more than 2 million vehicles in the US each year as we scale. At Orion assembly in Michigan, this includes production of the Cadillac Escalade followed by the launch of our next-generation full-size light-duty pickups. Adding Chevrolet Equinox ICE production at Fairfax assembly in Kansas and moving Blazer ICE production to Spring Hill in Tennessee will further reduce our tariff exposure and increase utilization of our existing US capacity. In addition, we will have even more flexibility to adjust our mix of ICE and EV production than we do today, which will help us operate both Spring Hill and Fairfax more efficiently in a slower growth EV market. Despite slower EV industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable for electric vehicle production, and this continues to be our North Star. As we adjust to changing demand, we will prioritize our customers, brands, and our flexible manufacturing footprint as well as leverage battery investments and other profit improvement plans. The battery strategy we are executing is central to our efforts to make EVs profitable and an even better choice for our customers. Domestically developed and produced cells are also necessary for a resilient and secure-oriented supply chain. Our joint venture cell plant in Indiana, for example, will produce prismatic cells to help lower pack and total vehicle cost. Foundation work is almost done, and more than 50% of the steel structure has been erected. We have also confirmed that Altium sells Springhill and Tennessee will begin producing LFP cells developed by our Korean partner LGES in addition to high nickel pouch cells starting in late 2027. The new lithium manganese rich or LMR chemistry that we are developing with LGES will be another game changer because of its unique balance of energy density, charging capability, and cost efficiency. Driven by its reduced nickel and cobalt content. In large truck packs, we believe the potential savings from LMR may be even greater than using LFP at today\\'s metal prices. Our expertise in leading cell chemistries and formats is also creating new business opportunities. Today, GM\\'s second life EV batteries are being repurposed by Redwood Materials. In addition, we\\'re finalizing an agreement with Redwood to supply battery modules to Redwood Energy, their new energy storage business, which has been formed to meet surging power demand for AI data centers and other applications. Importantly, all of the cells our JVs build have and will continue to qualify for the advanced technology manufacturing tax credits. And we\\'re grateful for the continued support of the administration and congress as we invest in American battery innovation and job creation. As you can see, we are well positioned to succeed in an ICE market that has now a longer runway. We will continue to drive improved profitability for ICE and focus on EV profitability improvement. To generate ongoing strong free cash flow. In addition, we\\'ll continue to drive American innovation in batteries, AV and software to further differentiate GM. Thank you, and I\\'d now like to turn the call over to Paul, who will share more details about the quarter.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.8\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"Thanks, Mary, and good morning, everyone. Appreciate you taking the time to join us. The team continues to execute well on our disciplined strategy which leverages our leading product portfolio and emphasizes prudent inventory management to support stable pricing while delivering consistent performance. Our agility and responsiveness to evolving consumer preferences and regulatory demands remain key strengths that set us apart. For the first half, total company revenue was a record $91 billion driven by strong demand, stable vehicle pricing, and continued growth at GM Financial. North America revenue was also a first-half record at nearly $77 billion, up slightly year-over-year. We maintained production levels in line with our full-year plan as early quarter sales acceleration normalized. This measured approach combined with strong sales that outpaced the industry reduced U.S. dealer inventory to 526,000 units, down nearly 10% year-over-year and almost 12% compared to the end of 2024. EBIT adjusted was $3 billion for the quarter, inclusive of a net tariff impact of approximately $1.1 billion with minimal mitigation offsets. As we\\'ve previously mentioned, mitigation efforts will take time to yield results. Limiting their effect on the second quarter. However, we\\'re still tracking to offset at least 30% of the $4 billion to $5 billion full-year 2025 tariff impact through strategic actions such as manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives, and consistent pricing. Looking at our sales performance, GM\\'s U.S. market share reached 17.3% in the first half of the year, marking a consistent upward trend and a 1.2 percentage point increase year-over-year. More than double the gain of our closest competitor. As Mary mentioned, continued growth across a number of SUV segments was a key driver with the Chevrolet Equinox standing out as its total sales rose more than 20% compared to the same period last year. Our share gains came on the back of strong product, not aggressive pricing. Indeed, in the first half of the year, our U.S. incentives as a percentage of average transaction price were more than two percentage points below the industry average, highlighting the strength of our product portfolio, our disciplined production strategy, and our sustained pricing power. Turning to capital allocation, we remain focused on striking the right balance between investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and returning capital to shareholders. During the second quarter, we announced nearly $900 million for the Tonawanda Propulsion plant to support our next-generation V8 engine. Along with a $4 billion investment in our U.S. manufacturing footprint. These strategic investments will expand capacity, support next-generation full-size SUV and pickup production, and enhance flexibility to shift between ICE and EVs based on market demand. Importantly, not all of this nearly $5 billion investment is incremental to our prior capital plans. A portion is being offset through cost efficiencies, internal reallocations, and by aligning the timing of investments with product updates. Our annual capital spending outlook remains unchanged at $10 billion to $11 billion for 2025, with a modest increase to $10 billion to $12 billion projected for 2026 and 2027. This includes key investments in our battery joint ventures such as Altium Cell\\'s production of LMR and LFP chemistries, as well as our partnership with Samsung SDI. With regard to our balance sheet, we issued $2 billion of debt during the quarter. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including a $1.8 billion term loan to Altium Sales LLC to support the voluntary early repayment of their U.S. Department of Energy loan as well as refinancing a portion of the $1.25 billion note maturing in October. Our balance sheet remains strong, which gives us ample flexibility in key future projects and to return capital to our shareholders. Speaking of shareholder returns, we completed the $2 billion ASR during the quarter, retiring an additional 10 million shares, which brought the total shares retired under this program to 43 million. On a diluted basis, this resulted in 971 million shares at the end of the second quarter, representing a 4% reduction since the end of 2024 and a 15% decrease compared to the end of Q2 last year. Supported by our strong cash flows with increased visibility around tariffs and the broader business environment, we resumed open market repurchases in early July. Let me now walk through the second quarter financial results in more detail. Total company EPS diluted adjusted was $2.53, and EBIT adjusted was $3 billion, down $1.4 billion year-over-year. This decline was primarily driven by a net tariff impact. We benefited from lower fixed costs, improved mix, and foreign currency impacts, which largely offset the effect of lower volume, EV inventory adjustments, and higher warranty-related charges. Adjusted automotive free cash flow was $2.8 billion, down $2.5 billion year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by tariff payments as well as headwinds from working capital and lower dealer inventory levels. In North America, we delivered EBIT adjusted of $2.4 billion and EBIT adjusted margins of 6.1%. Excluding the impact of tariffs, our margin would have been approximately 9%, which underscores the fundamental strength of our business. On a comparative basis, this keeps us well within our pre-tariff margin target of 8 to 10%. In addition to the impact of tariffs, warranty expenses have also been the main factors behind the higher warranty expenses relate to L87 issues and higher warranty claims from software issues on some of our early EV launches. Let me be clear. We are not happy with our warranty trend and are facing these challenges head-on, with the top priority always being our customers. We provided extended warranties in some instances and taken other proactive steps to support those affected, including shifting some supply of our components to our after-sales group to decrease repair times. To address the root causes, we are pursuing multiple paths. We are working to improve supplier quality across the board and are engaging more on critical component operations than ever before to ensure they consistently meet our high standards. Spending on a per-vehicle basis for software-related issues is down roughly 25% year-over-year when comparing most recently built vehicles to last year\\'s models. Our expanded use of over-the-air updates, lower number of incidents per vehicle, and increased robustness in our infotainment system updates are all contributing to this. Additionally, we are leveraging our enhanced diagnostics and developing new prognostic tools to identify issues sooner, develop repair procedures faster, and minimize unnecessary repairs. Complexity reductions enabled by winning with as seen on our recent Tahoe and Yukon launches. As we look to the second half of the year, we expect overall warranty costs to And for the full year, we now expect warranty to be a year-over-year headwind. We remain fully committed to continuously raising our quality standards and delivering stronger results for both our customers and our business. North America pricing was a $200 million headwind in Q2 compared to last year. We continue to benefit from robust retail pricing, particularly with our new vehicle launches. However, we experienced a year-over-year headwind in fleet pricing primarily due to increased competition resulting in pricing moderation. We expect the headwind from fleet pricing to continue into the second half of the year. GM International delivered second quarter EBIT adjusted of $200 million, an increase of $150 million year-over-year driven by improved profitability from our China equity income. We expect this strong performance to continue into the second half of the year. Our China team is executing well and launching competitively. Outside of China, our operations in South America and the Middle East continue to deliver consistent results. GM Financial delivered EBT adjusted of $700 million and is on track to deliver within the full year EBT adjusted range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. The team continues to grow the portfolio while paying a $350 million dividend to GM during the quarter. Credit performance and used vehicle prices remain healthy reflecting relatively stable underlying consumer demand and market conditions. Now turning to the forward outlook. Our guidance and most of our underlying assumptions remain unchanged at EBIT adjusted in the $10 billion to $12.5 billion range, EPS diluted adjusted in the $8.25 to $10 per share range, and adjusted automotive free cash flow in the $7.5 billion to $10 billion range. To help with your modeling, let me first provide some thoughts on the first half to second half comparison. EBIT adjusted for the first half of the year totaled $6.5 billion. At the midpoint of our full year guidance, this suggests that second half results will be about $1.75 billion lower. There are three key factors causing this dynamic. The first is an additional quarter of net tariff impact in the second half which accounts for around $1 billion of this gap. The second is that we expect North America wholesale volumes to be down a low. The last is increased spending related to preparations for the launch of our next generation full-size trucks, which are scheduled to begin rolling out as model year 2027 vehicles, including also ramping investments at Orion Assembly to increase capacity in the U.S. Now let\\'s move to a year-over-year perspective for the full year. We continue to plan for a full year total U.S. SAR of around 16 million units. This implies a second half SAR in the low to mid-fifteen million range. Pricing remains stable in the second quarter as well as so far in July. Our guidance assumes this continues throughout the second half of the year. Our full year North American pricing assumption is unchanged at a year-over-year. Turning to tariffs, the environment remains dynamic. The second quarter net impact of $1.1 billion was slightly lower than we had expected due to the timing of certain indirect tariff costs. As a result, we will likely see third quarter net tariff costs higher than in the second quarter. For the full year, while there have been some puts and takes since we gave our initial guidance, our gross tariff impact remains unchanged at $4 billion to $5 billion this year as we continue to produce and import vehicles from Canada, Mexico, and Korea to avoid interruptions for our customers and dealers. Over time, we remain confident that our total tariff expense will come down as bilateral trade deals emerge and our sourcing and production adjustments are. As mentioned earlier, we are making solid progress on our mitigation efforts and remain on track to offset at least 30% of this impact. With roughly one third coming from each of our key actions: manufacturing adjustments, targeted cost initiatives, and consistent pricing. Next, I\\'d like to address the recent EV legislation signed by the administration. While we are still seeking further clarification on certain aspects, we anticipate these changes. Our recent investments in U.S. manufacturing give us the capabilities to flex produce an ICE and EV mix based on changing customer demand. We also anticipate that a more rational EV market along with the need to balance regulatory requirements against reduced EV incentives positions us well for sustained profitability in the years ahead. I want to be clear that our EV journey is about giving consumers choice. And over the last few years, a steady number of consumers are choosing electric vehicles. We offer a compelling EV portfolio and see significant growth potential. Particularly in coastal markets where we remain underpenetrated. Now that we have a robust portfolio of EVs on the road, our investment focus has turned to driving down costs and improving profitability. Mary shared examples of how new battery chemistries and form factor factors are driving cost efficiencies. However, we are also working to improve efficiency by making our vehicles lighter and more aerodynamic, enabling us to achieve greater range with smaller batteries. We are also standardizing key components such as electric motors across models to drive scale and reduce complexity. While we anticipate headwinds to EV profitability from lower volume to the recent removal of government incentives, we remain focused on controlling what we can. These efforts are essential to improving our EV profitability and are critical to supporting the company\\'s long-term success. In closing, everything we\\'ve achieved in the first half of the year reflects the commitment and hard work of the entire GM team. By staying focused on our key priorities and investing in our future, we are well positioned to navigate a dynamic environment and deliver strong results.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.6\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Operator\", \"title\": \"Operator\", \"content\": \"As a reminder to analysts, we are asking that you limit your question to one. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Research. Your line is open.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.0\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mike Ward\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"Thanks.

Good morning, Mike. So think you\\'re referring to the lower of cost or market adjustment? Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So as a reminder, you know, with the sell inventory that we have we are required to mark any potential losses on that inventory and take it to the that reflects finished goods, etcetera. And as we work towards EBIT profitability, over time, that\\'ll start to come down. But as we are seeing adjustments in the market, as we are looking at expectations on pricing as well as production and demand, we made an adjustment to that reflecting what we think is future pressure on EV sales going forward related to that inventory. That number will, we expect, ultimately get better as inventory comes down and we see more stability in pricing. But think about it as more of timing from that standpoint.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.2\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mike Ward\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"And, you know, we expect that it\\'d get better over time. And just as it relates to tariffs, you\\'re taking as the world sits today, and you talked about the input, $4 to $5 billion mitigation, What would be the best case scenario? We get a settlement with US Canada, Mexico, Korea, what would the impact look like over the right now, like, for this year? If the world changed tomorrow, and it went back the other way? And then what do you have strategically that helps you from a performance standpoint as you go forward with your the $4 billion investment?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Yeah. Michael, it really I mean, obviously, our tariff impact would be lower if the tariffs with Mexico, Canada, and Korea were lower. So, you know, that would have an immediate impact, you know, have to look at how much lower it\\'s going to be to know what the total impact there would be. Right. But, yeah, that would have an immediate because as Paul said earlier today, we have continued to bring the vehicles in from Korea because they\\'re contribution margin positive, and they\\'re very much in demand. I mean, customers love those vehicles. Yeah. We\\'ve made some short-term shifts of production into our US footprint. I think what\\'s gonna happen, though, as we\\'ve always said, we feel we\\'ll be able to offset 30%. A lot of that will come in later this year as well as we\\'ll continue to make improvements across the board as we get into next year. In 18 months from now, the capacity, the $4 billion that we talked about that capacity will come online, and then that will have another step function improvement. And in some cases, the capacity we\\'re adding is also for unmet demand. So it\\'s a win-win from that perspective. So, you know, we\\'re on a, I think, a positive trajectory as we look into later this year into next year and clearly into 2027. We\\'ll be substantially better.

Your line is open.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.0\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Dan Levy\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanna start first with a question on pricing. And appreciate the commentary that the reason price in the North America EBIT bridge was negative on fleet, but we did see pretty solid third party data. So retail was tracking up decently based on the third party data. Retail is about majority of your sales. Maybe you could just double click on the dynamics there. And, you know, as far as the second half goes, how do we reconcile the assumption of pricing sort of held where it is versus the notion that as others run out of pre-tariff inventory and inventory is now more expensive, others may now need to raise prices.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.2\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"Hey. Good morning, Dan. Thanks for that. And you know, I\\'m not surprised by the question. You know, I think a couple of things. Number one, as we talk about fleet, it\\'s largely a comp issue too because remember what we\\'re lapping is fleet deals that were done under significantly tighter inventory than even where we are today at our tight levels. So, you know, we think that\\'s some normalization. I mean, we\\'re still comfortable with our pricing assumption of, you know, up a half to one percent for the year going forward. We had the strength in the first quarter. We have tougher comps really through the middle of the year, but as we launch our model year 2026 vehicles with, you know, our sort of regular pricing strategy that we\\'ve encountered, we still see that working quite well. So I think there\\'s a little bit of noise in the quarter here that we will work through, but nothing has changed about the full year. You know, there\\'s a lot of talk about out there about what people are going to do with they\\'re not going to do as we\\'ve said before, we\\'re pursuing our own sort of commercial path, one that is really centered around us. So despite having lower incentives significantly lower incentives than the industry average, we\\'re still picking up share. So, you know, I think to the extent that, you know, we see pricing change, we\\'re going to continue to look at it according to where we see the demand for our products, which remains strong.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.3\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Dan Levy\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"Okay. Great. Thank you. That\\'s helpful. Second question is just about the EV strategy going forward, and appreciate the commentary about you want to give consumers choice, but I now that the tax credit is on its way out and there\\'s changes in the regulatory schemes, I know we\\'ve been a broad lineup across price points, but the profitability has been challenged. And I think these changes indicate profitability is probably going to get a little trickier. So especially given you\\'re losing some of the scale benefits, which was supposed to drive profit. So how do we look at you know, the depth or the breadth of your EV lineup going forward and the price points at which you\\'re offering vehicles, when it seems like it\\'s just gonna be much tougher to get profitability at the more lower price point? Is it that we just see higher price points, and that\\'s the strategy?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Well, I think we\\'re, you know, we have a very strategic EV portfolio when you look at luxury trucks and then the affordable vehicles like the Blazer and the Equinox EVs. And so we think we\\'re covering the market very well. Before we even had IRA and the $7,500 tax credit, there still was demand for EVs. And we think as charging grows, and one of the things we highlighted because we are continuing very capital efficiently through partnerships to make sure we continue to expand the EV charging network. I also think there\\'s an opportunity for EVs for those that have a two-car family that have a garage that they can charge. You know, it makes a lot of sense to have one of those two vehicles be an EV. So I think as we get through this period and we we go through the potential pull ahead and before the September first, where the consumer tax credit goes away, then we get to fourth quarter, we\\'ll probably see a little result of that pull ahead. We get into 2026, so I think we\\'ll start to understand what real EV demand is. What we have been saying is that what we\\'re investing going forward is largely focused on improving our EV profitability. The announcements we\\'ve made from a battery perspective, with LMR and LFP, some of the work that we\\'re doing as we move forward to have a lighter architecture is more aerodynamic, that allows us to use a smaller battery. So we\\'re very focused in this period of time to drive not just get to variable profit profitability but get profitability and then, you know, to continue to improve so we have appropriate and strong margins from our EVs as well. And then we\\'re very well positioned in the market for later in this decade into the next decade. We truly offer consumers choice. So we think we\\'ve got the foundation with the EV platform that we have that allows us to go from a very small vehicle all the way up to a super truck like the Hummer. We think that\\'s an advantage for us. We think there is going to be an EV market that will grow over time, albeit it will start lower and potentially grow more slowly. But we\\'re well positioned to do that. And, you know, right now, we\\'re seeing growth in both ICE and EV from a share perspective with, as Paul mentioned, very strong demand.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.7\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Dan Levy\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"And there\\'s a clear path to grow to get profitability on the affordable EV?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.3\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Well, you know, that that is what we\\'re working on from all aspects. And, definitely, the battery technology changes. And you know, as we grow with affordable, which is in the heart of the market, that gets us the scale benefits as well. So we are focused on each and every vehicle getting to profitability and we\\'re not going to stop until they do.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.6\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Operator\", \"title\": \"Operator\", \"content\": \"Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.0\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Ryan Brinkman\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on the impact of tariffs on your earnings power as we move beyond this year. Now earlier, you\\'d called out $4 to $5 billion of tariff impact over the course of 2Q through 4Q 2025. So annualizing to maybe $5.3 to $6.7 billion. The goal of mitigating at least 30% of the impact this year. But that was before the various investments in US manufacturing announced during the quarter. How should we think about these footprint actions impacting net tariff costs going forward? You know, what degree of tariff cost mitigation beyond the 30% target for this year do you think you might be able to accomplish after these investments come online in 18 months\\' time?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.2\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"Yeah. Good morning, Ryan. I\\'ll take that one. Thanks for the question. You know, we have highlighted that up to $4 billion to $5 billion, about $2 billion of it is Korea. And as Mary mentioned in their comments and recent question that, you know, obviously, the trade deals with Mexico, Canada, and Korea are gonna be important. We\\'re not speculating on what those are going to look like going forward, but, you know, there is a possibility, and I don\\'t a likelihood, if you will, that that ultimately, a tariff rate gets set at a lower level, which would ultimately bring that impact down. As far as the other aspects of the tariffs, you know, we talked about the $4 billion which will bring us when all that is implemented, producing over 2 million vehicles here in the US. That will take care of part of a large part of the other remaining tariffs that are out there. We\\'re still working through supply chain and other indirect tariffs, but we\\'re not speculating on what it\\'ll be. But I expect that it is likely lower than the current run rate of what you would see just as things shake out. Remember, we\\'re only 90 days into this. As to the 30%, I mean, these are shifts in the general operation of the business that we don\\'t necessarily think go away if tariffs are reduced. So, you know, I think we\\'ve got a longer-term plan to be able to mitigate a substantial part of this. You know, we\\'re obviously looking for things to normalize around these trade deals that will get done. And we expect that\\'ll happen. But, you know, it\\'s too soon to extrapolate that as a run rate into the future.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.2\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Ryan Brinkman\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"Very helpful.

Paul, just maybe turning back to the tariff comments, and I understand a lot has changed. But you did mention that you expected the biggest headwind to be in the second quarter, and now it seems like the third quarter. So maybe you could just sort of help us understand what you know, large buckets, what sort of changed within that.

Just any any color you have there.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Joe. You got it. It\\'s really on a lot of the indirect items that we were when we came out with the overall tariff guidance, we were estimating the timing on when some of that would hit. So, you know, I would expect that we would have more expense potentially in the third quarter, but we\\'re still tracking on that $4 to $5 despite all the changes that we\\'ve seen going forward. So, you know, it might be slightly higher in the third quarter, and that\\'s kind of what we\\'re thinking right now. On the cash side, we actually expect that cash impact you know, potentially to be lower. We\\'re still, you know, didn\\'t get the full benefit of the MSRP offset just because of the timing. So that\\'ll materialize in the second half of the year. On the cash side. But from an expense side, just think slightly higher in 3Q, but still on track for the $4 billion to $5 billion for the year.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.2\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Joe Spak\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"Okay. And then turning back to EVs and, you know, regulatory policy, but maybe from a little bit of a different angle, you know, I know in your K, you disclosed that last year you expensed a billion dollars for credits. Was wondering if you\\'d let us it doesn\\'t sound like you expect much sort of change to this year, but I was wondering if you could let us know how much you are counting on that expense to be this year.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"Yeah. Joe, it gets really complicated really fast as you might imagine with the different regulatory schemes. But what\\'s in there is CAFE, GHG, state regulations, etcetera. So what we know today is, you know, the CAFE penalties under the one big beautiful bill were were zeroed out. So we did have some balance sheet purchased credits that were there this year, but we also have some expenses that we had that already booked. That\\'s gonna basically be a wash for us. So I don\\'t expect any material adjustments from CAFE. GHG obviously has not been fully answered. We we have comments from the administration and, you know, in the one big beautiful bill, you know, there are changes to future compliance, but we\\'re still working through that across the board. So I think 2025 is a little bit of a transition year as we as we understand what the future landscape is going to be and what how that\\'s going to affect the credits and the liabilities that are on the balance sheet year.

Just first on the guidance, just given still the wide range second half of the year, $3.5 billion to $6 billion I\\'m just curious what some of the factors that could materialize that could cause you to be at the low versus high end of that range and whether you have a current bias within the range currently?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"So thanks, Itay. You know, as we, you know, have continued to practice as we generally use midpoint convention as how we\\'re thinking about things. The reason to not change is obviously there\\'s there\\'s still things working out. We don\\'t want a lot of volatility in our guidance from that standpoint. But as we as we look at the landscape, some of the things that that could help us are, you know, getting some of the offsets as we\\'ve talked about. Potentially overperforming on that. Some of the challenges are, you know, higher tariff rates for longer. But overall, you know, we\\'re aiming for the midpoint, and that\\'s that\\'s the way we try to shoot straight.

You know, that obviously fluctuates with changes in demand, but clearly the vehicle counts as we highlighted in our comments was down pretty significantly year-over-year. We have responded, I think, the right way with some component availability into our customer care and after-sales group to address some of the more specific warranty issues to make sure customers are getting their vehicles back faster. That was a very calculated measure that impacted our wholesales.

And Mary, about fifteen or twenty years ago, GM was leading the industry in humanoid robot development, working together with NASA on Robonaut one and then Robonaut two deploying an upper body humanoid on the International Space Station in 2011. Fast forward to today, and most of your key competitors have a humanoid program. And many, myself included, think that this market\\'s ten times larger than cars at least. So when can investors learn more about GM\\'s robotics chops in your in-house robot facilities? Mary, as an engineer, I\\'m sure you must be super excited about the opportunity to show investors where GM can dominate here. And, Mary, I actually think that this is good for the UAW because we need American human muscle to develop build and service these robots. So when are we gonna learn more?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.0\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Well, Adam, thanks. I actually didn\\'t work directly on that project, but it was in the area I was responsible for. So I know the NASA partnership you\\'re talking about very well. You know, also we have a very long and rich history with GMF. Excuse me. GM Robotics, GM Fun Ops. Sorry. And we still have a very, very strong partnership. So we have a core capability in the company for sure. There\\'s also partnerships that we\\'re looking at and strategic relations that we have. But as we look at automation overall, you know, our first look is we want to not only lead from what happens from a robotics perspective because remember, a lot of things that we leverage robotics for are areas where there\\'s safety challenges to do the work. If there\\'s ergo challenges, we have a very robust ergonomics program in this company to make sure people don\\'t get hurt doing their jobs. And then just difficult or very, you know, dirty tasks that frankly, no one wants to do and I don\\'t blame them. And so there\\'s a lot to do there. There\\'s also work to do to get rid of a lot of the indirect. But we\\'ve also done a lot of work from a winning with simplicity perspective, and we\\'ve talked about that for the last few years. But first has been focused on what was, I\\'ll say, some of the low hanging fruit to simplify how we go to market from a trip level perspective, free flow options, et cetera. But now we\\'re really getting into part design where the parts are just simpler parts or a part that integrates and does more functions. So there\\'s tremendous work going on across the company to lead to manufacturing efficiency. And then, like I said, as we go forward, we\\'re gonna continue to capitalize on core knowledge that we have in this company to make sure we\\'re driving efficiency. I\\'m also very proud of the fact that, you know, way back when when assembly lines and all the equipment in a plant was controlled by wires and relays, we did training programs partnering with the local community colleges to train our workforce to be able to leverage how we run automation today, you know, from a computer perspective we have an active training program that we right now where we\\'re training more and more electricians and technicians as we have more complexity in our plants. And so we\\'re going to continue to do that. Something I\\'m very proud of. And I do agree there\\'s huge opportunity for our workforce as we look to what technology has to offer to improve the jobs.

That sounds like stay tuned and bless you for investing in those important areas in our country. Just as a follow-up, on EV profitability. I want to return to that. Tesla is still seen as the benchmark in Western EVs by many. Maybe you\\'re now the new benchmark or the new emerging benchmark. But in Western EVs, they\\'re still the big dog. But if you remove ZEV credits, which is probably appropriate, and downstream retail, they\\'re loss-making. I mean, they\\'re worse than Reno. Their margins are worse than Stellantis. They would really love to have your GMI margins as so so add this to Elon\\'s. It seems to be also exiting the auto and clearly pulling capital out of the business and doubling down on AI and autonomy and robotaxis. So how does GM expect to be profitable with EVs when players like Tesla are apparently cannot. I was just wondering what you\\'d highlight as your differentiation in terms of how you configure the vehicles or your scale or something about, you know, working with the Koreans and your and your in-house work something. What when you benchmark Tesla, why are they loss-making and you feel that you can be profitable?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Well, I think, you know, one of the things I\\'m very proud of, and I\\'m not gonna comment on Tesla because there\\'s a lot there, and I as you know, I don\\'t usually comment on competitors. But I think when I looked specifically at General Motors, one of the reasons our EVs are doing so well from a customer perspective is they\\'re true to our brands, whether it\\'s Chevrolet, whether it\\'s Cadillac, whether it\\'s GMC, Hummer, and GMC. Also, beautifully designed vehicles that have the range and the performance that customers are looking for, whether you\\'re talking about a truck or all the technology and safety. We, you know, we put into an Equinox. We\\'re that\\'s what we\\'re known for, and that beautiful design with also efficiency. As Paul said in his opening remarks, we still believe we have tremendous opportunity to, as we did our first DB platform to make changes to that to drive more efficiency from a weight perspective, from a simplification perspective. The same is true for batteries, and we\\'re investing in future technologies that are gonna allow us to take significant cost out and then we will get scale. And one of the things I\\'m really excited about with how we grow, have been growing our share quarter after quarter is the support that we have from our dealers who now really understand EVs, they understand what the customer\\'s looking for. Like I said, I think we can improve that scale when we think about two-car families that have an opportunity to have one of those vehicles in the garage be an EV. Even before the charging infrastructure is built, it\\'s gonna be beautifully designed products, with brands people trust. Remember, we have the highest loyalty. Going to be having the right technology on the vehicle, getting that scale, and then the engineering solution. So I\\'m very, very bullish on where we\\'re gonna be on EVs as we continue to move forward in the next couple of years.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.8\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"And Adam, I\\'ll just add too. I think the other asset that we have is, you know, a lot is made about Tesla\\'s simplicity and their scale and clearly, you know, within a couple of narrow segments. They do have that and they realize some good advantages, and hats off to them. It also leaves them overexposed to a demand set that has been highly volatile. When you look at what we\\'ve done in Spring Hill and what we\\'ve announced that we\\'re going to do in Fairfax, we\\'re increasingly building flexibility into our operation, into our manufacturing plants that, as we go through this period of transition, however long it might be, where customers are adopting EVs at a slower or faster rate that is gonna change year to year, you know, for the foreseeable future. That built-in flexibility for us to switch between ED and ICE and make sure that we meet customers where they are is an inherent advantage that we have because we can absorb some of the cost of that manufacturing facility with more ICE production if EV demand goes down. So that flexibility is gonna be important for us as we go through the next several years, and I think it\\'s gonna be helpful on that journey.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.6\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Adam Jonas\", \"title\": \"Analyst\", \"content\": \"Thanks, Paul.

I wanted to do a little more maybe drilling down on the Korean operation you guys have. I know it\\'s a substantial part of the tariff amount, obviously. I know we all hope for a resolution there, but the cost dynamics there are better, I believe, than if you were to produce those vehicles in the US. Just curious in a worst-case scenario situation where we\\'re at this the current status quo and that continues prospectively, how do you think about the Korean business? Is the better economics there sufficient that you could continue working with the same kind of production, same capacity, or would you make changes there? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Yeah. Tom, you know, we really have to see where this levels out.

It\\'s a very efficient operation that we\\'re very proud of, but we\\'ve got to evaluate when we have some certainty with what the tariff will be. So I\\'m not gonna speculate. Obviously, we\\'ve talked about it with the different choices that we have. But I\\'m not gonna speculate right now until we know where the agreement between Korea and the United States lands. But it\\'s a operation we\\'ve had for a long time that\\'s very efficient and high quality. Again, as I mentioned, you know, right now, the vehicles that we produce there, they\\'re in high demand. And they sell our contribution margin positive.

And then as you think about, you know, outside the US, you know, China looks like it was maybe a surprise positively, your performance there, despite all the negativity we hear in the press with the domestics there. But then the flip side in Europe, you\\'re hearing a lot of negativity from large OEMs this week with all the competition there. How do you think about these two markets for GM? Is it better just to stay focused in the US where you guys are so dominant? Or do you see opportunities, especially with the EV side, you know, battery cost coming down in the future, presents a great opportunity for you guys to kind of expand further in those two markets?\", \"sentiment\": \"0.3\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Mary Barra\", \"title\": \"Chair and CEO\", \"content\": \"Well, I think from a China perspective, now that, you know, we announced the restructuring last year, and it\\'s on track, very proud of the fact that the team has is gaining share. I think we\\'re the only foreign OEM or foreign brands to be able to gain share positive equity income. And I think there\\'s an opportunity. You know, there\\'s with what we know today from the geopolitical situation, the relationship between the two companies, countries, I think there\\'s an opportunity for Cadillac and Buick to be strong there. You know, Buick has a rich history there and the brand means something to the Chinese consumer, and Cadillac is viewed as a luxury and a great choice. I mean, one of the vehicles we have there is the GLA which has been a very, very successful product. And now that we have it out, from a new energy vehicle perspective, it\\'s doing quite well. So I think with what we know today, we can have a smaller but strong business that can grow in China. And I think that\\'s something that we\\'re gonna be continuing to focus on. I\\'m really proud of the team there. And then from a Europe perspective, I think there\\'s a lot of changes that are happening in Europe right now from a regulatory perspective, from what\\'s happening, you know, from a competition perspective, especially from the Chinese. I think over time that will settle out. We\\'re we think we have an opportunity in that market. Very proud of the fact that the Lyric was named German luxury car of the year last year, first American brand ever receive that honor. So I think we have especially our EVs that can do very well in the European market. But I think there\\'s some stabilization that has to happen of what is the policy situation across Europe that will inform the next step we take. And then you didn\\'t mention South America, and I think we have huge opportunity from a South America perspective.

We obviously wouldn\\'t telegraph that. But you\\'re right, we had as of the end of the quarter $4.3 billion remaining on that authorization. And as we\\'ve said, we\\'re sticking with our free cash flow guide and you would expect that seasonally there\\'s going to be more cash generation in the second half versus what we did according to that guide when you look at the midpoint.

Is there any also an opportunity or appetite at GM to try and reduce the overall capital intensity of the business? Obviously, your CapEx remains very, very stable and steady. Just curious if with this, you know, lower EV market, predicted as well essentially easier rules to follow, if there is any appetite there to actually just say, well, maybe down the line at some point, we don\\'t need to spend as much on a go-forward basis as an overall company.\", \"sentiment\": \"0.1\"}, {\"speaker\": \"Paul Jacobson\", \"title\": \"Executive Vice President and CFO\", \"content\": \"Well, Emmanuel, I think, you know, from a capital perspective, you know, feel very comfortable with where we are at the ten to eleven, and then we\\'ve announced that, you know, with the footprint changes, we\\'ll go to ten to twelve over the next couple of years, but still very much in line with affordability and balanced capital allocation and capital levels that on an inflation-adjusted basis are similar to what we did in 2018 with much better cash flow performance. So when you look at EVs, I wouldn\\'t say that we\\'re gonna be spending significantly less. What I would say is the composition of the investment is changing where we have been out expanding the portfolio and making sure that we can meet customers where they are. Our capital is now focused on where can we structurally in our that we\\'ve made on the battery technology and the teams are hard at work looking at other things such as aero and materials.

A copy of today's release with supplemental schedules and slides is available on our website, fcx.com. Today's conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call. A replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and slides and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings, all of which are available on our website. Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board; Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other senior members of our management team. Richard will make some opening remarks. Kathleen and Maree will review our slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for questions.\",\n",

Earlier this morning, FCX reported its second quarter 2025 operating and financial results. A copy of today\\'s release with supplemental schedules and slides is available on our website, fcx.com. Today\\'s conference call is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website homepage and clicking on the webcast link. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today\\'s call. A replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today. Before we begin our comments, we\\'d like to remind everyone that today\\'s press release and certain of our comments on the call include non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and slides and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings, all of which are available on our website. Also on the call with me today are Richard Adkerson, Chairman of the Board; Kathleen Quirk, President and Chief Executive Officer; Maree Robertson, Executive Vice President and CFO; and other senior members of our management team. Richard will make some opening remarks. Kathleen and Maree will review our slide materials, and then we\\'ll open up the call for questions.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.5\"},\"1\":{\"speaker\":\"Richard Adkerson\",\"title\":\"Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"Thank you, David, and thank you all for joining us. Copper is currently in the spotlight, of course. COMEX prices are hitting all-time highs. LME prices are strong. Uses are growing. Electricity means copper and the world is increasingly electric. This results in high demand, and the industry continues to be challenged to find the supplies to meet this demand and future demand. Governments are focused on critical minerals, including copper. Our company is strongly positioned. One-third of our copper is in the U.S., roughly one-third in Indonesia, and one-third in Peru and Chile. We are the dominant producer in the U.S., producing over 70% of the country\\'s refined copper. We\\'re fully integrated. We have substantial organic growth in the U.S., and we\\'re committed to that growth. Freeport committed to its strategy to copper over 20 years ago. Our tagline has been foremost in copper, and that\\'s what we\\'re striving to be. The start-up of the Indonesian smelter is a big accomplishment. Congratulations to the team at Freeport. We will now be effectively fully integrated as a producer globally. We are pleased to see the trade agreement between Indonesia and the United States and productive discussions with President Prabowo and former President Trump. We conveyed to the Indonesian leaders negotiating the deal to note that Freeport, a widely held public company in the U.S. with almost a 60-year history of operating in Indonesia, is the operator of the world\\'s second-largest copper mine located there. Grasberg operations and district is our cornerstone asset. In this most recent quarter, we had a net credit for operating cost of $1 a pound. This asset has enabled us to create the modern Freeport. With the smelter nearing completion, we are progressing our discussions with the Indonesian government about extending our operating rights beyond 2041. Doing so would create great value for FCX shareholders, but it also would be very positive for all stakeholders in the operation. With those comments, I\\'ll turn the call over to Kathleen and Maree to report on our quarter and our outlook.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.8\"},\"2\":{\"speaker\":\"Kathleen Quirk\",\"title\":\"President and Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"Great. Thank you, Richard, and I\\'ll cover the highlights of the second quarter starting on Page 3. We generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter and achieved significant milestones on several important initiatives. Our sales of copper and gold were better than expected, and net unit cash production costs during the quarter of $1.13 per pound were significantly improved from what we guided to and from last year\\'s second quarter. With an average quarter copper realization of over $4.50 per pound, which was about $0.20 per pound above the international benchmark pricing, we generated quarterly EBITDA of $3.2 billion and operating cash flows of $2.2 billion. Our sales volumes exceeded production as we were successful in reducing inventories in Indonesia, both at the mine site in our newly commissioned precious metals refinery, which performed well during the second quarter. As we look at the balance of the year, we\\'re well positioned for continued strong financial performance. Our sales of copper in the second half are expected to be nearly 10% higher than our first half volumes, and gold sales after taking into account revisions to our Grasberg gold production, which we\\'ll talk more about, are expected to be similar to the first half levels. The current premium on our U.S. copper sales, which recently tripled from second quarter levels, adds additional margins and cash flows. As we look ahead to 2026 and 2027, volume growth and lower costs set us up nicely to expand margins and cash flows as we move forward. We achieved a major milestone in the quarter with the start-up of our new copper smelter in Indonesia, a project we\\'ve been working on for the past 10 years. We started up about a month ahead of schedule and have progressed start-up activities to the stage of producing our first cathodes, which we expect by the end of this month. We remain focused on ramping up to reach design capacity by the end of the year. Another really exciting development during the quarter was the start of a field trial at our U.S. Morenci mine using an internally developed leach additive. Our team of scientists have been working on this for some time, and we are progressing work on additional options, which are showing very impressive lab results. There\\'s more work to do, but we\\'re making real progress. Identifying the right additive combined with our precision leaching operating practices will be a big step toward reaching our objective of producing 800 million pounds per annum from this initiative. We continue to advance optionality in our organic growth pipeline, and we\\'re well positioned with our significant resources and experienced team and our strong financial position. We purchased 1.5 million shares of stock during the second quarter, bringing our first half stock purchases to 2.9 million shares at an average cost of $36.41 per share. And we continue to target 50% of excess cash flow for shareholder returns in line with our financial policy. Turning to the next slide on 4. It\\'s a summary of our 2025 priorities. We\\'ve covered these on previous calls, and these are the areas that are defining our everyday pursuit of value creation. First, execution, mastering the basics and making every day count are our key objectives. We\\'re focused on delivering our plans safely and efficiently and driving our costs lower, particularly in the U.S. Scaling the leach opportunity is a major value driver for Freeport. We continue to target a 40% increase in our run rate to achieve 300 million pounds by the end of the year on our path to 800 million pounds per annum. Delivering the smelter, a safe and efficient ramp-up of the PTFI smelter is strategically important. It will de-risk our plans and position us for extension of our long-term operating rights in Indonesia. With the early startup, we\\'re well on our way. We posted a video this morning of the progress on our website, and we hope you had the chance to review it. We\\'re very proud of what our team is accomplishing there. Innovation is an increasingly important value driver for our business. Our operating teams are embracing technologies and new tools to enable better productivity and cost performance. And we\\'re continuing to build optionality in our growth portfolio. We have three major project opportunities being advanced in the Americas, which we\\'ll talk more about. Turning to copper markets on Slide 5. Copper has been actively covered in the media recently with widespread recognition of the rising strategic importance of this essential metal and a broad use of applications. Market fundamentals remain positive, underpinned by copper\\'s increasing use in the global economy and is an important driver of electrification, global energy requirements, and defense systems. Copper prices averaged $4.32 on the London Metals Exchange during the quarter and $4.72 on the U.S. COMEX Exchange. Following the July 8 U.S. tariff announcement, U.S. prices rose significantly. While tariff policies have dominated headlines and resulted in rising inventories in the U.S., global exchange inventories remain at low levels, particularly in relation to consumption trends. Copper demand globally continues to benefit from the secular trends and major new investments in AI technology, power infrastructure, decarbonization, and transportation. In the U.S., demand continues to be supported by these secular drivers, and we are seeing improving trends in Europe. China continues to be a major driver of copper demand, and India represents an important growth market in the future. As we\\'ve talked about in the past, the fundamentals of the copper markets are highly attractive with the outlook for demand growth to outpace available supplies as we go forward. Here at Freeport, we\\'re in a great position to increase volumes in the coming years to supply a world with growing requirements. Moving to Slide 6, we talk about the regional premiums and the market differentials between the U.S. pricing benchmarks and international benchmarks. For background, the reference price for Freeport\\'s copper sales contracts is based on geography. Our international sales are based on the London Metals Exchange price, and our U.S. sales are based on the U.S. COMEX reference price. These two benchmarks have been closely correlated in the past. But as you can see, a differential emerged earlier this year after the U.S. opened the Section 232 investigation, and the differential widened significantly earlier in July following the U.S. announcement of a 50% tariff on copper imports with an expected implementation date on August 1. We\\'re still waiting on additional details on the implementation of the tariff announcement. The U.S. currently imports approximately half of its copper cathode requirements, and the current domestic supply of cathodes is mostly produced by Freeport. As indicated in the charts, as of yesterday\\'s close, the U.S. premium approximates $1.25 per pound or about 28% above the LME price. This implies an approximate $1.7 billion annual financial benefit on Freeport\\'s U.S. sales. In the longer range, the differential will be determined by market factors, including how the tariff structure is applied to various copper products, available domestic supplies, and requirements for imported copper and other factors. We\\'re actively working to boost domestic supplies of copper with a special emphasis on growing our refined production in a cost-effective manner through our innovative leach initiative, and we\\'re focused on supporting the growing requirement for our U.S. customer base. Freeport is an important American copper producer and is by far the largest contributor to the U.S. copper market with an established and successful franchise dating to the late 1800s. As America\\'s copper champion, we appreciate the administration\\'s recognition of copper as a critical mineral and the efforts underway by the U.S. government to boost domestic production. Our operations in the U.S. supply approximately 70% of the refined copper produced here. Our operations in the U.S. are fully integrated with mines and smelting and refining facilities and innovative leach processes that efficiently produce refined cathode. About 60% of our U.S. production is sourced through leaching processes and the balance through our smelter. We employ a large workforce in the U.S. And importantly, we\\'ve earned the trust of communities in the Southwest U.S. where we operate and with our U.S. copper customers. In talking about our global refined metal on Slide 8, Freeport is a significant producer. With the completion of our new smelter in Indonesia, Freeport will essentially be fully integrated globally with internal processing facilities for its mine production. This is important because countries are becoming more and more focused on critical mineral supply chain resilience, national security issues, and global trade. Freeport\\'s positioning as a major producer of refined copper is of strategic significance for the long term. As indicated, we produce a substantial amount of refined copper from leach processing, which does not require a smelter process. And we\\'re going to continue to pursue innovative opportunities to add refined copper on a cost-effective basis. Moving to operations on Slide 9. We\\'ll talk about the operating highlights by geographic region, starting in the U.S., where we continue to drive operating disciplines to enhance efficiencies and improve cost and margins. We\\'re making progress as indicated by the improved performance compared with the year-ago quarter. With several initiatives underway, there\\'s more opportunity ahead. Our operating teams are benefiting from new tools and data analytics to drive value. We continue to rebuild skills within our workforce to reduce reliance on more costly contractors. As we look forward, we expect production in the U.S. to increase in 2025 and 2026 compared with 2024 levels. Absent changes in commodity-based input costs, we\\'re targeting unit costs to trend to the $2.50 per pound range in 2027. The autonomous haul truck conversion at our Bagdad mine in the U.S. will allow us to test this potential of applying this technology for use at other locations. At Bagdad, we have half of the autonomous trucks in service and expect to complete the balance over the next few months. We have several initiatives in progress to achieve further scaling in our innovative leach program. This is a high priority. Our teams are now much better equipped with new data and analytic tools, expanded areas under leach, and precision leaching processes to achieve higher recoveries and material previously considered waste. Achieving our targeted run rate to 300 million pounds per annum will benefit 2026 production. We are planning projects to use heat in our injection process to further enhance recoveries, and we\\'re advancing internally developed leach additives to provide additional volumes toward our ultimate target of 800 million pounds per annum. As I mentioned, a field trial is underway at Morenci with our first internal generated additive, and we\\'ve recently identified a potential second additive with initial lab testing indicating superior performance compared with anything we\\'ve seen to date. In addition, we\\'re advancing new technology and automation in our basic mining processes to optimize performance. Our work to date indicates a significant opportunity for value creation through meaningful cost reduction and reserve expansion within our existing operations. We\\'ll also continue to advocate for U.S. legislation to recognize copper formally as a critical mineral and eligibility for incentives to promote domestic production. Moving to South America. The team at our Cerro Verde operation posted another solid quarter with volumes and costs in line with our expectations. As anticipated, volumes at Cerro Verde were below the year-ago quarter because of lower ore grades. At El Abra, we have advanced plans to test heated raffinate injections in our leach stockpile there, expected in 2026, and that is targeted to increase copper recovery and metal volumes. We continue to plan for a major expansion at El Abra, which would capitalize on the large resource we have there and bring substantial scale and operating efficiencies to the mine. In Indonesia, during the second quarter, copper and gold sales were boosted significantly by a reduction in concentrate and in-process inventory following the mid-March approval of our export permit and good performance at the newly commissioned precious metals refinery, which processed all of the anode slimes produced at PT Smelting during the quarter. Milling rates improved in the second quarter compared with first quarter levels, and that reflected a restart of our SAG3 mill in the second quarter. In April, we commenced a large planned maintenance project on our SAG2 mill, which is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter. This will set us up for a return to mill rates in the 220,000 tonne per day range in the fourth quarter and beyond. Notably, during the second quarter, net unit cash costs at Grasberg were actually a net credit of $0.99 per pound. As indicated, the smelter start-up in the second quarter was a meaningful accomplishment, and we\\'re working to ramp up in the balance of the year. We have revised our near-term outlook for gold to incorporate adjustments to our drawpoint flow model in the Grasberg Block Cave. This resulted in an approximate 15% reduction in expected 2025 gold production but did not significantly impact long-range plans as indicated on the next slide. We provided some information on Grasberg ore grades on Slide 10. For background, the Grasberg Block Cave is one of three currently producing block cave mines in the Grasberg District. It\\'s the same ore body we mined from the surface for over 25 years prior to transitioning to underground mining in the 2020 time frame. For those of you who have followed us over time, you\\'ll recall there are sections within the Grasberg ore body with significant grade variation, especially for gold. This results in large swings in gold grades depending on where the material is coming from within the ore body. At the Grasberg Block Cave, we extract ore from five production blocks and have over 900 drawpoints currently producing within these five production blocks. We have a practice across the company of updating our forecast quarterly, taking into account all available information. For our block cave mines, we use industry-proven software to model cave flows and ore grades. During the second quarter, we experienced lower grades for gold than our scheduling model estimated and undertook a process to review our ore grade models. We recalibrated the model on a drawpoint-by-drawpoint basis to better reflect the timing of various ore grades flowing through the drawpoints. Importantly, the changes are timing related and not expected to impact the ultimate recoveries over the life of the deposit. In looking at the updated model, we were able to replicate historical results with better precision than the prior ore grade distribution model. You can see from the revised multiyear production forecast that the impact is limited to 2025 gold production. Over the five-year period, the actual aggregate production of gold is close to our prior estimates, and there was no significant impact on copper production. With the completion of major mill maintenance in 2025, we\\'re set up to increase mill operating rates in the future. Also in our 2025 forecast, we\\'ve incorporated an increase in copper concentrate consumption at the new smelter in Indonesia because of the earlier than forecast start-up. This results in more in-process inventory than previously forecast and is a timing item. We want to point out that as we transition from an exporter of concentrate to a fully integrated producer in Indonesia, there will be timing differences between production and sales by quarter. The sale of concentrates historically were recognized immediately on loading of ships at our mine site. With the smelter, sales will be recognized after processing and sale of refined metal. So this is really a timing match between production and sales. As we look forward, and I\\'m moving now to our project pipeline, it\\'s clear that additional copper supplies are required to support energy infrastructure, new technologies, and more advanced societies. We have an extensive copper resource position and a broad range of projects in various stages of development. These initiatives total 2.5 billion pounds of copper, which can be developed from Freeport\\'s known resources in jurisdictions where we have established history and experience. Our projects in Indonesia also have the benefit of high gold content that goes along with the copper. Because these projects are brownfield in nature, we benefit from leveraging existing infrastructure, our experienced workforces, and relationships with key stakeholders to move more quickly with less risk than a greenfield project. As we mentioned, we\\'re also looking at innovation and really feel this can bring improvements to the capital intensity of developing new projects. In the U.S., the projects have the potential to increase production by over 1 billion pounds per annum, with a large portion of that coming from low-cost and low capital-intensive incremental leach volumes. In addition, we have an actionable expansion opportunity at our Bagdad mine and are also studying the potential to expand and double production in the Safford\\\\/Lone Star district. In South America, we and our partner, CODELCO, are planning a major expansion at El Abra through the addition of a new concentrator that would provide 750 million pounds of incremental copper per annum. We\\'re completing our permit application. We expect to file that in early 2026, and we\\'re encouraged by the Chilean government\\'s initiatives to expedite the permitting process broadly in Chile. In Indonesia, our Kucing Liar development continues, and we expect to commence production by 2030. We\\'re conducting additional exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body and expect that with an extension of our operating rights beyond 2041, we\\'ll be set up for additional long-term development options in the highly attractive Grasberg District. We\\'ll continue to be disciplined in our approach, targeting opportunities that enhance long-term value. We\\'ve got some additional details on these projects covered on Slide 26 of the reference materials. Maree is going to cover our financial outlook on the next few slides, and then we\\'ll open up the call for your questions.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.7\"},\"3\":{\"speaker\":\"Maree Robertson\",\"title\":\"Executive Vice President and CFO\",\"content\":\"Thanks, Kathleen. Just moving on to Slide 12. We show our three-year outlook for sales volumes of copper, gold, and molybdenum. Our guidance for 2025 takes into account the Grasberg ore grade revision, which Kathleen has already discussed, and the timing of production versus sales associated with the smelter startup. 2025 guidance for copper is around 1% below the prior forecast, with gold sales down around 17%. But as discussed, these changes are not expected to impact our long-range plans and guidance for 2026 and 2027 remain consistent with our previous estimates, and continued success in our leaching initiative would provide upside to these estimates. We provide quarterly estimates on Slide 23 of the reference material. As you can see, copper sales in the second half of the year are nearly 10% higher than the first half. Our current estimate for net unit costs for the year 2025 using $3,300 for gold and $22 for moly is approximately $1.55 per pound, about $0.05 per pound above the April estimate, principally reflecting the impact of lower gold volumes, partly offset by higher prices of gold and molybdenum. The current unit net cash cost estimate is better than our estimate going into the year of $1.60 per pound. We are continuing initiatives to drive costs lower as we move forward. The details of costs by region are presented on Slide 22 in the reference materials. Moving to Slide 13. Putting together our projected volumes and cost estimates, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5. These are modeled results using the average of 2026 and 2027 with current volume and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $3,300 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $22 per pound. Annual EBITDA would range from over $11.5 billion per annum at $4 copper to over $15.5 billion per annum at $5 copper, with operating cash flows ranging from $8.5 billion per year at $4 to over $11.5 billion at $5. These estimates assume the U.S. price is the same as the international benchmark price. If we incorporate a 25% premium to our U.S. sales, which is similar to current levels, annual EBITDA would increase by approximately 10% and operating cash flows would increase by approximately 15%. A 50% premium would increase EBITDA by over 20% and operating cash flows by almost 30%. We show sensitivities to various commodities on the right side of the slide. You will note we are highly leveraged to copper prices with each $0.10 per pound change equating to approximately $425 million in annual EBITDA. We will also benefit from improving gold prices, with each $100 per ounce change in price approximating $150 million in annual EBITDA. Moving on to Slide 14. This shows our current forecast for capital expenditure in 2025 and 2026. Total capital expenditures over the two-year period are similar to our previous guidance, with some timing variances, which has deferred approximately $100 million of spend from 2025 to 2026. The discretionary projects are expected to approximate $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion per year in 2025 and 2026, with roughly 50% related to the Kucing Liar development and the LNG project at Grasberg. The balance includes acceleration of tailings and other infrastructure to support the Bagdad expansion, the Atlantic Copper Circular Project, which is expected to be completed by mid-2026 and capitalized interest. The discretionary category reflects the capital investments we\\'re making in new value-enhancing projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that is not distributed. These projects, which are detailed on Slide 31, will benefit our results in the future. We will continue to be disciplined in allocating capital to projects that enhance our position and generate attractive returns. This is consistent with our track record of efficient capital allocation and value-driven approach. On Slide 15, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing projects. Our balance sheet is solid with investment-grade ratings, strong credit metrics, and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on our projects. We don\\'t have any significant debt maturities until 2027. In addition to paying our first quarter base and variable dividend, we have repurchased $107 million of FCX common stock in the open market year-to-date. In total, we have distributed over $5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since adopting our financial policy of returning 50% of excess cash flow in 2021. We have an attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build long-term value for shareholders with the remaining 50%. We actively monitor current market conditions and carefully manage the timing of our projects to ensure our financial flexibility remains strong. Our global team is focused on driving value in our business, committed to strong execution of our plans, providing cash to invest in profitable growth, and returning cash to shareholders. In concluding today\\'s presentation on Slide 16, Freeport\\'s large scale, low-cost, proven producing assets, actionable low-risk growth options, experience and leadership in the global copper industry, as well as our advantageous U.S. footprint provide a strong foundation for the future. Thanks for your attention. We\\'ll now take your questions.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.6\"},\"4\":{\"speaker\":\"Operator\",\"title\":\"Operator\",\"content\":\"Our first question comes from the line of William Peterson with JPMorgan.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"5\":{\"speaker\":\"William Chapman Peterson\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"I wanted to ask about the changes in the mine plan. It seems that you review this on a quarterly basis, but could you clarify what has changed now? Did you notice these changes earlier, or did you require more data before deciding to alter the plan? Also, is there anything else that contributed to the modeling update and the plan?\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"6\":{\"speaker\":\"Kathleen Quirk\",\"title\":\"President and Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"Yes, thank you for the question. Mark Johnson is on the call if we need to provide any additional information. As I mentioned, we update our quarterly forecast regularly and also refresh our multiyear forecast each quarter. At Grasberg, we analyze each ore body to assess expected rates and determine grades using a well-established modeling software that the industry standardizes for block caving. We noticed in the first half of the year some discrepancies between the actual recovery of ore grades and what our model predicted. Historically, our model has closely matched actual results. We recalibrated it previously at the end of 2023, which did not have significant effects. However, we undertook a thorough review of the various settings within the scheduling model and created an updated calibration that closely aligned with our historical results. It\\'s essential to consider the variations in grade within the ore body. We extract ore from 900 drawpoints, and the timing of ore flow can change from different sections, especially below the pit. You may recall that we previously identified a very high-grade gold core at the bottom of the open pit. The dynamics of the ore flows is mainly about understanding and scheduling their progression through our grades. While we were quite accurate in recalibrating the model for the long term, it did result in some short-term effects. Mark, would you like to add any insights to these comments?\",\"sentiment\":\"0.5\"},\"7\":{\"speaker\":\"Mark Johnson\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"No, I think you handled it very well, Kathleen. One thing I want to mention is that as we start mining from a drawpoint, we feel confident because the material is just above the area we are mining as we continue to pull through this column of rock. Some of it is up to 500 meters above us, which makes estimation a bit more complex. Not all the material moves through that column at the same rate; smaller material tends to pass through more quickly. We also have material that shifts laterally and can end up in other drawpoints. This leads to more mixing as you go higher up. Our team is world-class, and the tools we use are also top-notch. We didn\\'t see much variability in the copper; it remains stable in grades, but the gold can change in value quite dramatically over relatively short distances, similar to what we experienced in the open pit.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.4\"},\"8\":{\"speaker\":\"Operator\",\"title\":\"Operator\",\"content\":\"Our next question comes from the line of Katja Jancic with BMO.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"9\":{\"speaker\":\"Katja Jancic\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"Maybe, Kathleen, you mentioned you continue to expect costs in North America to decline over the next two years. But if I\\'m not mistaken, that doesn\\'t incorporate expectations for the impact from tariffs. Can you maybe talk a bit about how could tariffs impact that outlook?\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"10\":{\"speaker\":\"Kathleen Quirk\",\"title\":\"President and Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"We\\'re closely observing the effects of tariffs. As the importer of record, Freeport hasn\\'t experienced a significant impact so far. The larger concern we\\'re addressing with our suppliers is their input costs. We have established a task force to ensure that our suppliers are not simply passing on price increases. We\\'re delving into the data to better understand potential implications. Currently, we estimate that tariffs might cause about a 5% increase in our costs, although negotiations are ongoing. We\\'re exploring ways to adjust our supply chains and collaborating with our vendors to source as many materials as possible that are tariff-free. Tariffs on steel and aluminum are affecting us to some extent, but the copper situation, which we\\'ve discussed, benefits us more significantly. While tariffs are impacting our operating costs, the effect is not substantial. The cost savings we\\'re discussing stem from efforts to enhance efficiencies via innovation, focusing on core operations, streamlining contractor use, reducing unplanned downtime, and improving asset efficiencies. Our asset health in the U.S. is in a better position than in recent years. With inflation easing somewhat, we are in a strong position to lower costs. Numerous automation projects are in progress, and the leach initiative will provide incremental pounds at a low cost, which is encouraging. We anticipate strong performance from our U.S. business in the future. Additionally, we have net operating losses in the U.S. that can improve our margins and cash flows, providing a significant opportunity. We\\'re committed to enhancing value in our U.S. operations through efficiency and cost reduction programs, along with the advantages we gain from the premium.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.5\"},\"11\":{\"speaker\":\"Operator\",\"title\":\"Operator\",\"content\":\"Our next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"12\":{\"speaker\":\"Orest Wowkodaw\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"A couple of questions, if I could.

We discussed our technology and innovations that could help us bring additional refined copper online in the short term, though it\\'s important to note that refined copper cannot be ramped up quickly due to the limited operating smelters in the U.S. In the short term, we aim to enhance refined production through our leach initiative. We\\'ve also discussed the IRA benefits related to critical minerals, which currently do not include copper, and we are working to change that. With new legislation phasing out some IRA benefits, we are encouraged by the focus on permitting reforms and hope to secure long-term incentives that could significantly enhance U.S. refined production. Richard has also participated in various discussions on this matter. We are well-positioned and actively working on our Bagdad expansion and completing the autonomous truck conversion.

This figure does not include the additional revenues generated from selling concentrate to the smelter, as they take a percentage of the metal being sold. This will reflect in our revenues, approximately 2.5% for the extra volumes. However, the net cost will be credited. When considering the smelter\\'s impact, the net cost will likely be around $0.15 or $0.16 after accounting for revenue effects. Additionally, the export duty, which was around $0.30 or more in the second quarter, will also be eliminated. Ultimately, this should enhance our margins.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.5\"},\"19\":{\"speaker\":\"Operator\",\"title\":\"Operator\",\"content\":\"Your next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder from BofA Securities.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"20\":{\"speaker\":\"Lawson Winder\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"I wanted to just follow up on the Indonesian question there about potentially sending refined copper from Grasberg to the U.S. So just looking at the agreements as we know them today and then looking at what the import tariffs are as proposed, so 50% versus 19%.

The logical places in the near term will be continued to sell in Asia, but we\\'ll look at what makes the most sense. As the U.S. is looking at its strategic interest in critical minerals, having a U.S. company with significant ownership of this operation in Indonesia gives the U.S. essentially a security of supply if it makes sense. Today, the trade flows are mostly, as you know, copper coming to the U.S. from places like Chile, Canada, and Peru as well.

We\\'re doing some work, and we have been doing some work even before this on whether there\\'s an opportunity on a cost-effective basis to expand the Miami smelter. We\\'re continuing to study that, as well as whether there\\'s an opportunity potentially to recover some additional scrap and use our infrastructure in the U.S. to do that. That\\'s been very limited historically, and we\\'ll look at whether there\\'s an opportunity to do it in the future. So we\\'re looking at an expansion of Miami. I want to emphasize the real opportunity for us in the near term to get more refined metal in the U.S. is continued success with our leach program. I mentioned the additive trial we\\'re doing. We\\'re making some progress on additional additives. That combined with our precision leaching processes as well as introducing heated raffinate into the solutions that we\\'re injecting into the stockpiles will be beneficial for us.

Can you just outline what\\'s holding you back at the moment in terms of increasing the pace of share repurchases? And if I can, one quick follow-up on Indonesia. I know you\\'ve said the 2026 guidance on copper and gold is unchanged. But given the variability you\\'re experiencing, what level ofconfidence do you have or can you really have in that medium-term gold guidance?\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"26\":{\"speaker\":\"Kathleen Quirk\",\"title\":\"President and Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"On the first question regarding the buyback, we are applying our financial policy, which is to distribute through dividends and share buybacks 50% of our available cash flows. That\\'s about where we are through the program, at about 50%. We\\'ve just seen this change on the U.S. premium; it tripled from the second quarter. Should it continue to be significant as it is today, that will provide more cash flow for shareholder returns under the policy. Regarding being below our net debt target, half was for shareholder returns, and half was for balance sheet or profitable growth. We have several projects that we are looking at that like the Bagdad expansion project, which we haven\\'t made a decision on, but potentially that could use some of the other 50% generated since we put the policy in place at the end of the second half of \\'21. We should have, as we look forward at today\\'s prices, more cash flow to deploy to our shareholder returns. With respect to the gold volumes, we go through a comprehensive process every quarter. We feel confident with the modeling that we\\'ve done and that we feel that the gold grades are there. We were impacted in the first half by two major maintenance projects. One of the concentrators was down for the first quarter in Indonesia, and the second one is down now, but those are expected to be completed at the end of the third quarter, and we\\'ll be able to increase our mill rates and keep the mine rates going. We feel confident in using the best information we have today. Mining carries risks, but we\\'re working hard with the data we have. You can look at our historical performance; we\\'ve done pretty well in executing and keeping our information up to date so that we don\\'t have surprises. The other area that\\'s really important for us is getting the smelter up and running. In the fourth quarter, we expect to not be exporting concentrates in the U.S. Our plan does not assume any exports in the fourth quarter, and all of it will be coming from the new smelter.

With respect to the Miami expansion, we\\'ve been looking at something on the order of a 30% increase to the current concentrate treatment. The Miami smelter is performing very well, and that team has been very helpful. The Atlantic Copper team has been very helpful with our new smelter in Indonesia and helping our team there to achieve the ramp-up. But we\\'ve been looking at something on the order of a 30% increase. On the Lone Star project, it will be kind of like Morenci, where you have a significant portion of production coming from the leach volume. Depending on how we do with our leach additive, we may have the option to send more to leach production as opposed to concentrating. However, we do have a part of the Lone Star deposit that has both copper and gold in the grade, which will require a concentrator.

We do have flexibility to send it to the place that makes the most sense. I mentioned that the trade flows currently are logistically advantaged, selling it in Asia. We\\'re very focused on what is happening in Indonesia with respect to domestic production.

COMEX prices have increased more than 40% year-to-date. I don\\'t think we\\'ve ever seen such a significant price rally in such a short time from a relatively high starting point. The U.S. industrial economy isn\\'t exactly performing optimally right now. I\\'m curious about the demand implications of this substantial price spike in the U.S. and globally, especially with LME prices also rising. Are you observing if these price increases can be sustained, considering demand may be inelastic enough that higher prices won\\'t have much of an impact? Or are we nearing a point now with COMEX close to $6 a pound where we could see real negative effects on demand?\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"39\":{\"speaker\":\"Kathleen Quirk\",\"title\":\"President and Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"Thank you, Chris. It\\'s an interesting question. When we look at the demand drivers for copper and the secular trends, we see continued strong demand. What we do see from time to time, and we saw it last year in China, and you may see some of it in the U.S. is that when prices move rapidly in a short period of time, some customers will try to figure out if it\\'s real before they buy, and people are trying to understand what the implications of these tariffs are. The underlying trends are significant. Copper within big projects doesn\\'t end up being the biggest item. It\\'s a metal that is the best metal when it comes to conducting electricity. I can\\'t give you a precise answer about whether there will be any short-term impacts from it, but I think the long-term trends are positive in terms of needing copper to fulfill what we\\'re trying to do from a technology standpoint and overall energy infrastructure standpoint.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.7\"},\"40\":{\"speaker\":\"Richard Adkerson\",\"title\":\"Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"Yes. Let me mention a couple of points, Chris. The move you discussed reflects the global export of copper from the United States ahead of the tariffs, getting it in before the tariffs took effect. Now there\\'s a significant question about what the tariffs will ultimately be. Even at these prices, they don\\'t indicate the 50% tariff that was suggested, but we really don\\\\u2019t know. Once the tariffs are revealed, there will be adjustments in flows and possibly an increase in LME prices. Ultimately, global supply and demand will drive the market. Copper is challenging to replace due to its essential uses and properties. While there may be attempts to find substitutes as prices rise, the underlying demand will persist. Nothing conducts electricity like copper, so I believe the fundamental strength in demand will continue.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.8\"},\"41\":{\"speaker\":\"Stephen Higgins\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"No, nothing to add. That was very well said.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"42\":{\"speaker\":\"Christopher LaFemina\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"I was considering the competitiveness of downstream markets in the U.S. As these tariffs become permanent, will we see a shift in demand to other regions? I understand that the LME price is influenced by global supply and demand, and for Freeport, the COMEX premium is also significant. Will there be a change in the distribution of tons away from the U.S., which would reduce the benefits of the tariff for U.S. producers over time?\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"43\":{\"speaker\":\"Stephen Higgins\",\"title\":\"Analyst\",\"content\":\"Well, I think that very much depends on how it\\'s applied to downstream derivative products, which we don\\'t know.\",\"sentiment\":\"0.0\"},\"44\":{\"speaker\":\"Richard Adkerson\",\"title\":\"Chief Executive Officer\",\"content\":\"There\\'s another factor here that we haven\\'t mentioned on this call that\\'s a big uncertain. We have really only lobbied the federal government to make permitting more efficient and coordinate permitting between state and federal government. Today, we\\'re actually encouraging the government to reach a deal with our international partners that are favorable to both countries and trying to educate people. I\\'m sure you watch news commentators, and hear astounding comments like people wanting to open up these old smelters. They don\\'t realize those smelters are gone. It\\'s tough to build a new smelter nowadays where you have 0 or negative TCs and RCs. They have not raised the idea of government subsidies. We\\'re focused on the production credit applied to copper, but that\\'s a challenge. The thing that\\'s overhanging this is the impact of scrap in the U.S. There is primary scrap and secondary scrap. The U.S. has closed many secondary scrap processors due to environmental and cost issues. Most secondary scrap has been going to China or elsewhere. Some new secondary scrap facilities have opened up, and that\\'s a potential source of U.S. refined supply. But it\\'s complicated for the reasons I just mentioned.

That was…\\n\\n• A pronounced local low in the candlesticks (a “dip” into long-term uptrend support)  \\n• Accompanied by a trough in the P/E (purple line) down near 20—suggesting a momentary valuation sweet spot  \\n• Followed almost immediately by a sustained rally from the high-$270s back up toward $350+\\n\\nYou’ll notice smaller pullbacks—e.g. late October 2023 into the $295–305 range—also marked lower-risk entries ahead of the next leg up.  If you’re looking at the stock today (around $700+), similar logic would suggest waiting for a mild dip back toward your nearest technical support (for example in the $680–690 area) or a momentary decline in fundamentals (P/E) before layering in.\\n\\nOf course, past patterns never guarantee future performance.  Always do your own due diligence on fundamentals, set a clear stop-loss and position-size appropriately.'"

For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company&#8217;s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as &#8220;future,&#8221; &#8220;anticipates,&#8221; &#8220;believes,&#8221; &#8220;estimates,&#8221; &#8220;expects,&#8221; &#8220;intends,&#8221; &#8220;plans,&#8221; &#8220;predicts,&#8221; &#8220;will,&#8221; &#8220;would,&#8221; &#8220;could,&#8221; &#8220;can,&#8221; &#8220;may,&#8221; and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company&#8217;s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company&#8217;s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company&#8217;s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.</span></div><div id=\"i1cb1ba018cb1455aa66bd3f9ab0c5b1a_1525\"></div><div style=\"margin-top:18pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">Competition</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.

The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.</span></div><div id=\"i1cb1ba018cb1455aa66bd3f9ab0c5b1a_1531\"></div><div style=\"margin-top:18pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">Supply of Components</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Although most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources.

Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business.

Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers.

The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies.

Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.</span></div><div style=\"height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%\"><div style=\"bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7</span></div></div></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"/><div style=\"min-height:42.75pt;width:100%\"><div style=\"text-align:justify\"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements.

For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures.

Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:18pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">The Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide.

In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.

A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September&#160;30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia.

Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.</span></div><div id=\"i1cb1ba018cb1455aa66bd3f9ab0c5b1a_19\"></div><div style=\"margin-top:18pt;padding-left:45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-45pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">Item 1B.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unresolved Staff Comments</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">None.</span></div><div id=\"i1cb1ba018cb1455aa66bd3f9ab0c5b1a_1483\"></div><div style=\"margin-top:18pt;padding-left:45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-45pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">Item 1C.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cybersecurity</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Not applicable.</span></div><div style=\"height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%\"><div style=\"bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:8pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16</span></div></div></div><div id=\"i1cb1ba018cb1455aa66bd3f9ab0c5b1a_22\"></div><hr style=\"page-break-after:always\"/><div style=\"min-height:42.75pt;width:100%\"><div style=\"text-align:justify\"><span><br/></span></div></div><div style=\"margin-top:18pt;padding-left:45pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-45pt\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">Item 2.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Properties</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:9pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company&#8217;s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022.

exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company&#8217;s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company&#8217;s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company applied a value-at-risk (&#8220;VAR&#8221;) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September&#160;30, 2023 and September&#160;24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company&#8217;s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency derivatives.</span></div><div style=\"height:42.75pt;position:relative;width:100%\"><div style=\"bottom:0;position:absolute;width:100%\"><div style=\"text-align:center\"><span

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company&#8217;s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company&#8217;s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered.

When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company&#8217;s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company&#8217;s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company has identified up to <ix:nonFraction unitRef=\"performanceobligation\" contextRef=\"c-22\" decimals=\"INF\" name=\"aapl:PerformanceObligationsinArrangements\" format=\"ixt-sec:numwordsen\" scale=\"0\" id=\"f-368\">three</ix:nonFraction> performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products.

The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company&#8217;s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:12pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered.

The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application&#8211;related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:18pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%\">Management&#8217;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</span></div><div style=\"margin-top:6pt;text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#000000;font-family:\\'Helvetica\\',sans-serif;font-size:9pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%\">The Company&#8217;s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

Many of the forward-looking statements are located in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Business” and Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-K regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.\\nUnless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.\\nCloud Services\\nThe Company’s cloud services store and keep customers’ content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers.\\nDigital Content\\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store\\n®\\n,\\n that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.\\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade\\n®\\n, a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+\\nSM\\n, a personalized fitness service; Apple Music\\n®\\n, which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+\\n®\\n, a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+\\n®\\n, which offers exclusive original content and live sports.\\nPayment Services\\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card\\n®\\n, a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay\\n®\\n, a cashless payment service.\\nSegments\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\\nMarkets and Distribution\\nThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.\\nCompetition\\nThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.\\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.\\nSupply of Components\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.\\nResearch and Development\\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\\nIntellectual Property\\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.\\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3\\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.\\nHuman Capital\\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.\\nWorkplace Practices and Policies\\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.\\nInclusion and Diversity\\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.\\nEngagement\\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.\\nHealth and Safety\\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.\\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.\\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.\\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.\\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.\\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nThe Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.\\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5\\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.\\nMany of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.\\nGlobal markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\\nThe Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.\\nThe Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6\\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its\\xa0intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.\\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.\\nThe Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.\\nBusiness Risks\\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services.\\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.\\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7\\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.\\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.\\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.\\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “\\nThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,\\n” above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components\\n. \\nTherefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.\\nThe Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.\\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8\\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk.\\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.\\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.\\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\\nThe Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.\\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company’s products.\\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’ platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.\\nThe Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.\\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9\\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.\\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.\\nThe Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.\\nMuch of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.\\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.\\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10\\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.\\nThe Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.\\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.\\nThe Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.\\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes.\\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or its vendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11\\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\\nThe Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.\\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\\nThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations.\\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase.\\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.\\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12\\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nThe Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.\\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business by increasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.\\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13\\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.\\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings.\\nThere can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.\\nThe Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.\\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.\\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.\\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14\\nFinancial Risks\\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.\\nThe Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners.\\nThe Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.\\nThe Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.\\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.\\nThe Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15\\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.\\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses.\\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.\\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\\nGeneral Risks\\nThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.\\nThe Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\\nItem 1B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Cybersecurity\\nNot applicable.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16\\nItem 2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Properties\\nThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California.

(“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “Circuit Court”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple’s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire.\\nMasimo\\nMasimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, “Masimo”) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “ITC”) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the “Order”) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal.\\nOther Legal Proceedings\\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\\nItem 4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Mine Safety Disclosures\\nNot applicable.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 17\\nPART II\\nItem 5.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\\nThe Company’s common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol AAPL.\\nHolders\\nAs of October\\xa020, 2023, there were 23,763 shareholders of record.\\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\\nShare repurchase activity during the three months ended September\\xa030, 2023 was as follows (in millions, except number of shares, which are reflected in thousands, and per-share amounts):\\nPeriods\\nTotal Number\\nof Shares Purchased\\nAverage Price\\nPaid Per Share\\nTotal Number of Shares\\nPurchased as Part of Publicly\\nAnnounced Plans or Programs\\nApproximate Dollar Value of\\nShares That May Yet Be Purchased\\nUnder the Plans or Programs \\n(1)\\nJuly 2, 2023 to August 5, 2023:\\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\\n33,864\\xa0\\n$\\n191.62\\xa0\\n33,864\\xa0\\nAugust 6, 2023 to September 2, 2023:\\nAugust 2023 ASRs\\n22,085\\xa0\\n(2)\\n(2)\\n22,085\\xa0\\n(2)\\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\\n30,299\\xa0\\n$\\n178.99\\xa0\\n30,299\\xa0\\nSeptember 3, 2023 to September 30, 2023:\\nOpen market and privately negotiated purchases\\n20,347\\xa0\\n$\\n176.31\\xa0\\n20,347\\xa0\\nTotal\\n106,595\\xa0\\n$\\n74,069\\xa0\\n(1)\\nAs of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company was authorized by the Board of Directors to purchase up to $90 billion of the Company’s common stock under a share repurchase program announced on May 4, 2023, of which $15.9 billion had been utilized. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.\\n(2)\\nIn August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASRs”). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company’s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASRs’ purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 18\\nCompany Stock Performance\\nThe following graph shows a comparison of five-year cumulative total shareholder return, calculated on a dividend-reinvested basis, for the Company, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Technology Supersector Index.

Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September\\xa024, 2022.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each.\\nFiscal Year Highlights\\nThe Company’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023.\\nThe Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.\\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following:\\nFirst Quarter 2023:\\n•\\niPad and iPad Pro;\\n•\\nNext-generation Apple TV 4K; and\\n•\\nMLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service.\\nSecond Quarter 2023:\\n•\\nMacBook Pro 14”, MacBook Pro 16” and Mac mini; and\\n•\\nSecond-generation HomePod.\\nThird Quarter 2023:\\n•\\nMacBook Air 15”, Mac Studio and Mac Pro;\\n•\\nApple Vision Pro™, the Company’s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS™, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and\\n•\\niOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company’s operating systems.\\nFourth Quarter 2023:\\n•\\niPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and\\n•\\nApple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix.\\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage.\\nServices Gross Margin\\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs.\\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix.\\nThe Company’s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in

Taxes\\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions):\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nProvision for income

rate\\n21\\xa0\\n%\\n21\\xa0\\n%\\n21\\xa0\\n%\\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.\\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3\\xa0billion as of September\\xa030, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.\\nThe Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:\\nDebt\\nAs of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months.\\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.\\nLeases\\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.\\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.\\nOther Purchase Obligations\\nThe Company’s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months.\\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable\\nAs of September\\xa030, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”) was $22.0\\xa0billion, with $6.5\\xa0billion expected to be paid within 12 months.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24\\nCapital Return Program\\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25\\nItem 7A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022 (dollars in millions):\\nInterest Rate\\nSensitive Instrument\\nHypothetical Interest\\nRate Increase\\nPotential Impact\\n2023\\n2022\\nInvestment portfolio\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nDecline in fair value\\n$\\n3,089\\xa0\\n$\\n4,022\\xa0\\nTerm debt\\n100 basis points, all tenors\\nIncrease in annual interest expense\\n$\\n194\\xa0\\n$\\n201\\xa0\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.\\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company’s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 26\\nItem 8.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\\nPage\\nConsolidated Statements

Preparation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.\\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.\\nRevenue\\nThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.\\nShare-Based Compensation\\nThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.\\nCash Equivalents\\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.\\nMarketable Securities\\nThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.\\nInventories\\nInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.\\nDerivative Instruments\\nThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.\\nLeases\\nThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33\\nNote 2 – \\nRevenue\\nThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company’s expectations and historical experience.\\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\\nThe Company has identified up to \\nthree\\n performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\\n®\\n, Siri\\n®\\n and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34\\nNet sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\niPhone \\n(1)\\n$\\n200,583\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n205,489\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n191,973\\n\\xa0\\nMac \\n(1)\\n29,357\\n\\xa0\\n40,177\\n\\xa0\\n35,190\\n\\xa0\\niPad \\n(1)\\n28,300\\n\\xa0\\n29,292\\n\\xa0\\n31,862\\n\\xa0\\nWearables, Home and Accessories \\n(1)\\n39,845\\n\\xa0\\n41,241\\n\\xa0\\n38,367\\n\\xa0\\nServices \\n(2)\\n85,200\\n\\xa0\\n78,129\\n\\xa0\\n68,425\\n\\xa0\\nTotal net sales\\n$\\n383,285\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n394,328\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n365,817\\n\\xa0\\n(1)\\nProducts net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.\\n(2)\\nServices net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.\\nTotal net sales include $\\n8.2\\n billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa024, 2022, $\\n7.5\\n billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa025, 2021, and $\\n6.7\\n billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September\\xa026, 2020.\\nThe Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.\\nAs of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $\\n12.1\\n billion and $\\n12.4\\n\\xa0billion, respectively.

measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\\n(2)\\nAs of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022, total marketable securities included $\\n13.8\\n billion and $\\n12.7\\n billion, respectively, that were restricted from general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 36\\nThe following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September\\xa030, 2023 (in millions):\\nDue after 1 year through 5

debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.\\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to \\n12\\n months.\\nTo protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currency transactions is \\n19\\n years.\\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.\\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2023\\n2022\\nDerivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n74,730\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n102,670\\n\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\n$\\n19,375\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n20,125\\n\\xa0\\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n104,777\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n185,381\\n\\xa0\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37\\nThe gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September\\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2022\\nFair Value of\\nDerivatives Designated\\nas Accounting Hedges\\nFair Value of\\nDerivatives Not Designated\\nas Accounting Hedges\\nTotal\\nFair Value\\nDerivative assets \\n(1)\\n:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n4,317\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2,819\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n7,136\\n\\xa0\\nDerivative liabilities \\n(2)\\n:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\n$\\n2,205\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n2,547\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n4,752\\n\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\n$\\n1,367\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n1,367\\n\\xa0\\n(1)\\nDerivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\n(2)\\nDerivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\nThe derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September\\xa024, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $\\n7.8\\n billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $\\n412\\n million.\\nThe carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2023\\n2022\\nHedged assets/(liabilities):\\nCurrent and non-current marketable securities\\n$\\n14,433\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n13,378\\n\\xa0\\nCurrent and non-current term debt\\n$\\n(\\n18,247\\n)\\n$\\n(\\n18,739\\n)\\nAccounts Receivable\\nTrade Receivables\\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had \\none\\n customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for \\n10\\n%.

The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.\\nVendor Non-Trade Receivables\\nThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the Company had \\ntwo\\n vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for \\n48\\n% and \\n23\\n%.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €\\n13.1\\n billion, plus interest of €\\n1.2\\n billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision.\\nOn an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €\\n12.7\\n billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over \\nfour years\\n, based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a \\none\\n-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock.

The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.\\nConcentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product\\nAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.\\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.\\nSubstantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46\\nNote 13 – \\nSegment Information and Geographic Data\\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.\\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.\\nThe following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions):\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nAmericas:\\nNet sales\\n$\\n162,560\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n169,658\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n153,306\\n\\xa0\\nOperating income\\n$\\n60,508\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n62,683\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n53,382\\n\\xa0\\nEurope:\\nNet sales\\n$\\n94,294\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n95,118\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n89,307\\n\\xa0\\nOperating income\\n$\\n36,098\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n35,233\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n32,505\\n\\xa0\\nGreater China:\\nNet sales\\n$\\n72,559\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n74,200\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n68,366\\n\\xa0\\nOperating income\\n$\\n30,328\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n31,153\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n28,504\\n\\xa0\\nJapan:\\nNet sales\\n$\\n24,257\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n25,977\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n28,482\\n\\xa0\\nOperating income\\n$\\n11,888\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n12,257\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n12,798\\n\\xa0\\nRest of Asia Pacific:\\nNet sales\\n$\\n29,615\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n29,375\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n26,356\\n\\xa0\\nOperating income\\n$\\n12,066\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n11,569\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n9,817\\n\\xa0\\nA reconciliation of the Company’s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions):\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nSegment operating income\\n$\\n150,888\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n152,895\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n137,006\\n\\xa0\\nResearch and development expense\\n(\\n29,915\\n)\\n(\\n26,251\\n)\\n(\\n21,914\\n)\\nOther corporate expenses, net \\n(1)\\n(\\n6,672\\n)\\n(\\n7,207\\n)\\n(\\n6,143\\n)\\nTotal operating income\\n$\\n114,301\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n119,437\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n108,949\\n\\xa0\\n(1)\\nIncludes corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, various nonrecurring charges, and other separately managed general and administrative costs.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 47\\nThe U.S. and China were the only countries that accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021. \\nNet sales for 2023, 2022 and 2021 and long-lived assets as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet sales:\\nU.S.\\n$\\n138,573\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n147,859\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n133,803\\n\\xa0\\nChina\\n (1)\\n72,559\\n\\xa0\\n74,200\\n\\xa0\\n68,366\\n\\xa0\\nOther countries\\n172,153\\n\\xa0\\n172,269\\n\\xa0\\n163,648\\n\\xa0\\nTotal net sales\\n$\\n383,285\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n394,328\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n365,817\\n\\xa0\\n2023\\n2022\\nLong-lived assets:\\nU.S.\\n$\\n33,276\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n31,119\\n\\xa0\\nChina \\n(1)\\n5,778\\n\\xa0\\n7,260\\n\\xa0\\nOther countries\\n4,661\\n\\xa0\\n3,738\\n\\xa0\\nTotal long-lived assets\\n$\\n43,715\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n42,117\\n\\xa0\\n(1)\\nChina includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 48\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September\\xa030, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September\\xa030, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September\\xa030, 2023, based on criteria established in\\n Internal Control – Integrated Framework\\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November\\xa02, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\\xa0relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\\xa0involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of the Matter\\nAs discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September\\xa030, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $\\n19.5\\n billion, of which $\\n9.5\\n billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.’s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws.\\nAuditing management’s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our Audit\\nWe tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management’s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management’s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures.\\nTo evaluate Apple Inc.’s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management’s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.’s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.’s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.’s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements.\\n/s/ \\nErnst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as Apple Inc.’s auditor since 2009.\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember\\xa02, 2023\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September\\xa030, 2023, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September\\xa030, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September\\xa030, 2023 and September\\xa024, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September\\xa030, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November\\xa02, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nApple Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nNovember\\xa02, 2023\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51\\nItem 9.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\\nNone.\\nItem 9A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Controls and Procedures\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September\\xa030, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i)\\xa0recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii)\\xa0accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\\xa0\\n(i)\\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;\\n(ii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and\\n(iii)\\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nManagement, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company’s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September\\xa030, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management’s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 52\\nItem 9B.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Other Information\\nInsider Trading Arrangements\\nOn \\nAugust 30, 2023\\n, \\nDeirdre O’Brien\\n, the Company’s \\nSenior Vice President, Retail\\n, and \\nJeff Williams\\n, the Company’s \\nChief Operating Officer\\n, each \\nentered\\n into a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act.
